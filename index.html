It was commissioned in 1631 by the 5th Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare complex, which includes a mosque and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall. It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7-8 million visitors a year and in 2007 it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World initiative.</p>

Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. Tourist numbers peaked at 1.1 million in 2019, marking the first time that the figure rose above the 1 million mark.</p>

Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC, with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220-206 BC), the first emperor of China. Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade, watchtowers, troop barracks and the control of immigration and emigration.</p>
